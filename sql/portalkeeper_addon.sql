-- Optional. Only for realms that hand out addons with Portalkeeper
-- (https://github.com/buildthehomelab/wow-Portalkeeper) through mod-realm-config.
-- Makes the Journal addon required for every player, in place of the DungeonJournal addon it
-- replaces. Run it by hand against acore_world.
-- It is kept out of data/sql on purpose: the table belongs to mod-realm-config, and a
-- failing statement there would stop the database import at startup.
